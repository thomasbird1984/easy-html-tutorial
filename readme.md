# Easy HTML Tutorial

This is a very basic html, css and javascript tutorial meant to open you to the basics of programming and give you a taste of web development. 

### Basics
To get started simply open up terminal and `cd` (change directory) to the root of this folder. Once there run the following command `php -S localhost:<port>`. You can run this app on any port you want, for instance if you wanted to run it on `8000` your command would look like the following: `php -S localhost:8000`.

From there open up a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You will see the contents of `index.php`. Open this file up in your favorite IDE and start hacking away.
