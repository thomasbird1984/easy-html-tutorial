            <p>What are html (hyper text markup language), css (cascading stylesheets) and scripting languages? I always like to use the anology of a car, likewise I like to explain a website as a car. If you think about a car it has three different major parts that become the car. For instance you have the frame, styling and then the motor. A website has something similar, html is the frame of your website it gives you the core frame of your websites structure. CSS is the styling of the car, in website terms that means that it will control everything you see visually from font colors, to the type of layout and much more. The engine of a car is like the scripting that most websites employ, scripting does things like dropdown menus, information intake from users, storage of data and file uploads are just a couple examples.</p>
            <p>Back 10 yrs ago html used to be very basic with only a limited number of tags supported. Tags are the way you tell the browser what any given piece of content is. No a days though html has a multitude of tags that are supported dependent on the browser. Web browsers like chrome, firefox or safari all implement html tags and styles differently in addition to also lacking support for some features. This can be a headache for a developer because you have to know what tags are supported and can even be used. There are great resources though for finding out what you can use such as "caniuse.com"</p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>

            <p>Html tags are the building blocks of the web, they're typically formatted like so: <span class="code-highlight">&lt;tag_name&gt;Content to be contained&lt;/tag_name&gt;</span>. Html tags almost always have a starting and ending tag, in rare cases with tags like <span class="code-highlight">&lt;img /&gt;</span> there are no closing tags instead the end of the tag contains a <span class="code-highlight">/</span> signifying the end of that tag.</p>
            <p>Many times html can be used to identify the kind of content its holding, for instance a <span class="code-highlight">&lt;p&gt;</span> tag contains paragraph content and an <span class="code-highlight">&lt;a&gt;</span> anchor tags contain links to other places in a page or another website. Typically html tags always have starting and ending tags at the beginning and end of whatever they contain.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>

            <p>CSS, simply put is the styling of your website, it controls everything from font sizes, spacing and all visual aspects of the application you're developing.</p>

            <p>Major parts of the website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selectors</li>
                <li>CSS Rule format</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Selectors</b> are how we can identify the html elements that we want to style. There are 3 main ways to identify the tags we are trying to target. First is the most basic, the actual tag name. Second and most important we can identify them by class names or id's. Third we can identify tags by combinations of tag names, classes, ids and attributes.</p>
            <p>Here is some example html markup and some example selectors:</p>

            <span class="code-highlight code-highlight--block">
                &lt;div class="wrap"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
                &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br/>
                &lt;p id="test"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            </span>

            <span class="code-highlight code-highlight--block">
                .wrap {<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 600px;<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0 auto;<br/>
                }<br/><br/>

                ul {<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list-style: circle;<br/>
                }<br/><br/>

                #test {<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: helvetica, arial, verdana;<br/>
                }
            </span>

            <p><b>Rules</b> have 2 major parts, the name of the rule and the actual rule. For instance, <span class="code-highlight">background-color: red;</span>. Here you see a `:` this is what divides the name of rule from the actual rule. At the end you have a `;` which denotes that this is the end of the rule. If it is the last rule in the set of rules then it doesn't technically require you to put an ending `;` but I do it because it's safer and so that when you go to add more rules you don't forget to add the `;`.</p>
            <p>So now you know about selectors and rules lets put it altogether.</p>
